# Detection module SQL
Detection module wrapper for sqlmap, used with ModuleMatcher

For more information, visit https://github.com/Dubrefjord/ModuleMatcher which has a propper README file! :)

To use this module, sqlmap must be installed and must be runnable by simply writing "sqlmap" in the terminal. If Sqlmap is installed using pip this should solve itself. Otherwise, it can be added as an alias
